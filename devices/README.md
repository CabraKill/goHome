### Features

Like a REST API, it has operations like GET, POST and DELETE using the corresponding  HTTP method.

* GET: Returns the list of devices.

* POST: Adds a device to the database. 

	* > If a device with same Ip and Name existings the operation overrides it.

* DELETE: Deletes a device with same Ip and Name if exists.

### Infrastruct
```
ðŸ“¦devices
 â”£ ðŸ“‚driver
 â”£ ðŸ“‚model
 â”£ ðŸ“‚readme
 â”£ ðŸ“‚repository
 â”£ ðŸ“œdevices.go
```

### Database

The current need of the database is managing the devices while the server is operating. Since the data infrastruct is horizontal with all its properties, a json list is implemented in memory to work as the database.
